I've never been so stupid in my entire life. 

Elise Parrish, my teammate's incredibly sweet and gorgeous younger sister, should have been off-limits, but my hockey stick didn't get the memo. 

After our team won the championship, our flirting turned physical, and I took her to bed. Then shame sent her running the next morning from our catastrophic mistake. 

She thinks I don't remember that night--but every detail is burned into my brain so deeply, I'll never forget. The feel of her in my arms, the soft whimpers of pleasure I coaxed from her perfect lips....

And now I've spent three months trying to get her out of my head, but I'm starting to understand she's the only girl I'll ever want. 

I have one shot to show her I can be exactly what she needs, but Elise won't be easily convinced. 

That's okay, because I'm good under pressure, and this time, I'm playing for keeps.

In a delightful twist of fate, Lady Isabella found herself inadvertently ensnared by Riverdale's most powerful magnate, Alexander Windsor. Rumors swirled, predicting her doom, yet she effortlessly transformed into the cherished wife he seemingly couldn‚Äôt bear to part with for even a moment, as if wishing to keep her in his pocket or tethered to his side at all times.
Isabella Sterling quirked a lip, "A mere two billion, I shall return it then‚Ä¶‚Äù
The man leaned in, his charm palpable, ‚ÄúAnd how do you propose to repay? With your heart, or something more tangible?‚Äù
Since taking residence at The Windsor, Mr. Alexander‚Äôs incurable condition miraculously improved. He ate well, worked tirelessly, his demeanor blooming like spring peaches, heart swelling with joy, capable of sleeping soundly for three days straight without a care.
Until one day, someone unwittingly stumbled upon the lady‚Äôs secrets.
The top hacker shaking the core of Caloria was her!
The financial tycoon whose name echoed around the globe was her!
The prodigious healer with the golden touch was her, her, and again her...
The elite ladies of high society wept, their makeup smeared, as they faced a fearsome rival. "You go first, I'll retreat!"
In Riverdale, where a mere stomp of Mr. Alexander's foot could cause a tremor, he famously said, "A king does not live off his wife, unless she is overwhelmingly beautiful!"

"Listen to me! As much as I don't want to touch you and vice-versa, I'm the only one who can help in ending your suffering RIGHT now!" he said as one of his hands slipped into my shirt, and I moaned as he cupped one of my breasts.

I had the most perfect life of a she-wolf. My dad, the Alpha of the Black Heart Pack doted on me so much despite me being wolfless. I was loved and respected in the pack under¬†his¬†protection. 

But everything changed on my 18th birthday. I was accused of being a traitor and banished from the pack. Left with nothing, I was nearly raped and killed, until the Alpha and Beta of the Crimson Blood Pack saved me. 

There was always something about Beta Kyson that drew me to him. It turned out he was my mate!

But‚Ä¶ he was no Beta and I wasn‚Äôt weak.

And the truth hurt more than the lies.

Ever since Heather Abrams walked in on me in the bathroom, naked and sporting one of the worst erections of my life, I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about her, about the way she stood there and devoured me with her eyes, about the way her body would feel beneath mine, about how she‚Äôd sound screaming my name. There‚Äôs just one problem: she‚Äôs the nineteen-year-old daughter of my closest friend, and she‚Äôs totally off-limits.
 
ONE NIGHT CHANGES EVERYTHING‚Ä¶

When a severe thunderstorm rolls in, knocking out the power and trapping us in a much too small room, I can barely keep my hands to myself. But when she touches me, all bets are off. Heather will be mine, even if that means losing everything I‚Äôve worked so hard for.

"Let me go." I spat at him.

He sighed. "Let's get along this time, Mia."

"You wish." I struggled against him, trying to break free of his hold.

"Mia," he called my name again, exasperation in his voice.

"Why are the three of you unbelievable two-faced hypocrites? Presenting one image in public and acting differently from it in private. One would think that you are angels with the way you act in public. You might have your Dad and my Mum fooled but not me. You can't fool me, I know what you are like. I know the real you."

*

Quinn, Jack, and John, the triplets of misery from my high school days.

It would be foolish to entertain the idea of liking the boys who had once bullied and treated me with disdain. They were nothing like the wolves in my dreams; now, they played the role of gentle older brothers.

Learning that they were in the Navy seemed fitting, and I secretly hoped they encountered individuals stronger than themselves, who could give them a taste of their own medicine as they had done to me.

Later, to my astonishment, they claimed I was their mate.

"Let's keep it a secret from our parents, alright? We'll cherish you, Sis."

"Dad, I think something is wrong."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm smelling four."

"Four?"

"Yes, there are four different scents. I don't know how to explain it but they all have the same earthly scent, but something else to it. What does that mean?"

"You have four mates."

"Four mates? That can't be real, I have never heard of that before." Avery was in a state of panic now, which caused her to involuntarily transform back to her human form.

*USA Today Best-selling author* Time to break the rules and make her submit to me‚Ä¶

We dance like devils, except we wear masks.
Every night a different one.
Dancing on the edge.
Dancing with danger.
Me and her, for years.

I‚Äôve allowed her to think she doesn‚Äôt already belong to me.
Time to change that up and claim her.

Possess her, dominate her, own her.
Heart. Body. Mind. Soul.

I‚Äôm Salvatore Giordano and I always get what I want.
I want her to be mine.
Submitting to my every command.
Fulfilling our wild fantasies.
I‚Äôll make her cave to temptation.

I thought it would be simple.
Until the day when the past and present collide.
Skeletons tumble out of the closet whispering secrets on their lips.

I get caught in a blood war with a target on my back.
And, she sees something she shouldn‚Äôt have.
My enemies come for me and know she‚Äôs my weakness.

They want her.
Heads roll, and the streets fill with blood.
It‚Äôs kill or be killed.
The ruthless against the heartless.
I have to become both to protect her.
Even if it costs me everything.

"Take off your undies completely", he said in a low voice as I did.

As soon as the Alpha caught the scent of the girl in heat, his primal instincts took over. He could feel his wolf stirring inside 

He followed the scent until he found her, huddled in a corner, shaking and panting with desire. She was in the midst of her first heat, and the Alpha could see the desperation in her eyes as she begged for release.

She knew that he hated her but maybe he wouldn't go hard on her like he always does and help her out for release.

****

Alpha Aiden had been wanting a mate for a long time but when he found her, she wasn't who he expected. She was far below his status for him to be with her and that fueled his anger and hatred.

Camille, a descendant of warriors but now a slave wanted nothing more than to be free but there was only one obstacle: her destined mate

Until her eighteenth birthday, when she overhears a conversation that leaves her with no other choice but to run away and never look back.

Luckily, she runs straight into the most handsome man she has ever seen, and he utters the one word (four letters) that changes her life forever: "Mine."

Jayden King is the alpha of the North Pack. The most feared alpha, he's often referred to as the Alpha of all Alphas. No one who trespasses on his land ever lives long enough to tell the tale. He is content with his reputation as a cold and heartless alpha‚Äîuntil he runs into someone he had long ago lost hope of finding. 

But instead of being the mate that Ava always hoped for, Jayden ignores her...

Axel Davers realizes as soon as he steps foot into his first college class that his mate is in the room. However, it blindsides him when he sees Claire Summers, the one girl he loathed in high school, sitting there with a rebellious snarl on her face.

When lycans begin to terrorize the neighboring packs and the college campus, Axel finds himself doing whatever it takes to protect his mate. However, Claire hates the sight of him, and even if she feels an invisible pull, she pushes him away until she breaks.

Pain. Torment. Hell. These are three words that Netayah "Tay" Greystone had grown accustomed to. On the night of her Awakening when her wolf failed to surface, she was cast to the shadows, a disgrace and weakness nobody in the pack wanted to acknowledge. 

Now three years later, her wolf still failing to emerge from the shadows, all have lost hope for an emergence. Months before her seventeenth birthday, Netayah finds her life spinning out of control, banished from her parents' pack. Now turned into a packless rogue, a death sentence placed atop her head, only the wasteland of No Man's Land can offer her safety. Even there in the realm of the rogues her life is in danger, as there is no loyalty among the beasts. Saved from an attack, Netayah awakes inside a hospital, realizing her savior had brought her to their pack for medical treatment. Now she has to find a way to escape, before the Alpha catches wind of her presence and sentences her to death. For any rogue caught within the boundaries of the pack is an immediate death sentence.

Only Tay hadn't found her way into the boundaries of just any pack. She'd been brought to the home of the Blue Diamond, the second largest, richest and most powerful pack in the territory. A pack ruled by the infamous Twin Alphas Xavier and Xiao, whose adventures had become legendary. The brothers are outraged at the thought a rogue had been brought into their territory while they were unaware, determined to cast her out. But at the bidding of their Beta who believed she deserved a chance, the alphas agree to meet with the girl.

"Have you forgotten our agreement? Or do you want me to remind you? You're not allowed to talk to any other man till you conceive my child Vanessa. I don't want to see you with my brother." 

"I'm sorry sir." I whispered softly, I felt so uncomfortable with the way his eyes were fixed on me, on my body. This towel was going to slip off any moment now, I thought, as I tried to back away from him. But he grabbed my arm tightly, pulling me closer to him. 

"I'll make sure you remember our agreement, Vanessa. And I always get what I want, you're mine alone." he said, his lips curling into a dangerous smile.

"Listen to me very clearly, Mrs. Livia Aaron Rodriguez, you are my wife now. So you can only think of me, talk to me, smile at me, look at me, and be around me only. You will do what I say."
"I am not your slave."
Ignoring her protest, he continued, "And if you are feeling needy and want to sleep with a man so much, then don't worry, just come to me and I promise you, I'll give you the best physical pleasure in this world. After all, I'm quite experienced in the physical pleasure department."
"Bastard!" she slapped his hand away, but Aaron caught her mouth and kissed her hard...

As the sunsets over Grey Moon, the atmosphere changes from happy and carefree to chilling and dreadful. There is a party going on to celebrate the birth of Alpha Jermey‚Äôs daughter. Most packs consider a girl as firstborn a disgrace but here it does not matter. The pack members had waited patiently for the birth of their next leader, whether it be a boy or a girl, they knew either way the baby would be strong because the Alpha was a Kolana wolf and their Luna was a Mattra wolf, they were wolves of legends as they were the last of their kind.

These wolves were once feared around the world and known for their strength and quickness. They were white as snow and as big as a tractor. They also had special abilities that helped them in battle and running a pack. As most know, the Kolana wolves and the Mattra wolves were created by the moon goddess herself. No one knew exactly why they were created but after the last war with the Lycans, they had been decimated to the brink of extinction. The remaining wolves had gone into hiding and only their packs knew of their existence. The Alpha and Luna of Grey Moon had been thrown together in a union to preserve their species by their parents before they passed away.

He leaned down, taking my chin in his hand, forcing me to look up into his blood-red eyes. His fangs were showing, dripping with the blood of my boyfriend, who lay on the ground, lifeless.

"You are mine, Bast. You'd do well to remember that," he purred, as he licked the blood off his lips. "No other man may take your innocence but me," he said, looking down at my nearly naked form, the lust in his eyes making me squirm.

"Yes, Damien," I whispered in response, covering myself in the sheet and looking over at the body of Jacob with a whimper.

My name is Bast. I'm seventeen years old, soon to be eighteen. When I was twelve, my parents sold me to the devil. On my eighteenth birthday, he will come back for me.

"I am bound to punish you for breaking the rules," he said as he started undoing his tie.

I swallowed, the thought of being punished by him terrified and excited me at the same time. 
I needed this.

The heat pooled between my legs as I watched him undo his tie with one hand and his belt in the other. It was hot.

He grabbed me by the neck, bending me over the table with my face down on the surface and my ass high up in the air. He caressed my soft flesh with his palm.

"Count," he ordered,

My brows furrowed in confusion, the haze of lust so heavy in my head that my brain failed to grasp his words. The first slap landed on my ass cheeks and I cried out.

"Count," he barked. I whimpered but I nodded my head to his request.

I held onto my stomach, crying in front of the father of the child I was carrying.
"Who is she, Laz?" the beautiful woman asked gently.
"Get in my car, baby," Laz told the woman. He turned to me with a harsh look. "What else are you looking at? Leave!" he shouted, causing more tears to fall.
I didn't leave; I stayed and continued crying in front of him.
"Laz? Why is she crying? Tell me," her voice was so gentle, like an angel.
"Get in my car, now, Samantha," Laz softly coaxed the woman.
My chest ached even more because of the way he treated her.
"L-Lazarus, please..." I begged until I found myself kneeling in front of him.
It hurt so much. It hurt like I couldn't bear it anymore. I didn't love him, but I didn't want my baby to grow up without a father.
I was doing this for the sake of the child, not just for my own desires.
I saw how he clenched his fists before I lowered my head and touched the floor.
He knelt down too and roughly grabbed my hair, forcing our gazes to meet.
He looked at me with intensity.
"I don't want to see your face. From now on, don't let me fucking push you away," he said.
His words made me cry even harder. He let go of my hair forcefully and stood up.
He wrapped his strong, muscular arms around Samantha's waist.
"Wait, Laz-"
"Get in, okay?" Lazarus interrupted Samantha and kissed her forehead.
Samantha had no choice but to get into the front seat of Lazarus's car.
Lazarus turned around and opened the driver's seat. He was about to get in, but he stopped when I stood up and spoke.
"Y-You're so selfish but thank you. Thank you for giving me this little blessing. I hope you sleep soundly every night, Lazarus."
He finally got into the car and drove away quickly.
I watched his car fade into the distance until I felt the rain pour down.
I caressed my belly. It's not that big. I'm three weeks pregnant and now I'm trying to convince my baby's father to help me.
But he didn't.
He left me pregnant.
"Y-Your daddy left us, baby..."

Myla Carter is a sexually repressed, bashful, and often awkward woman that has lived a very sheltered life (mostly of her own doing). A 23-year-old virgin, she has spent the better part of her life with weird hang-ups about intimacy. But after one drunken night, she decides she no longer wants to wait and texts her best friend, Sophia Moore, to send her up a booty call. Anyone will do. A short while later, there‚Äôs a knock at her door and she excitedly races to open it. 

On the other side is not a stranger as expected but the CEO of the company she works for and her ultra-sexy, charming, and sophisticated boss, Fabian Ness. In her drunken stupor, she accidentally texted her boss instead of Sophia. One innocent mistake, however, leads to an incredible night of mind-blowing sex. But when she wakes up the next morning, she has only the vaguest memory of who she actually spent the night with. Despite the fact that he is still in her bed, she hurries out of her own room, ashamed and feeling guilty for what she did. It‚Äôs not until later she remembers the whole truth. That she had sex with her boss. Fabian Ness has it all. He‚Äôs extremely wealthy, good-looking, and powerful. He can have anything or anyone he wants whenever he wants. But after a one-night stand with a woman he‚Äôs been infatuated with since high school, he can‚Äôt seem to get her out of his head. All he thinks about is Myla and all he wants is Myla. He realizes quickly that despite having everything he‚Äôs ever wanted and achieving so much, he is missing one key ingredient. Love.

This should be the least possible thing happened between Ogden and me, until I heard him saying‚Äî
‚ÄúWillow, I need someone to marry me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said, marry me Willow.‚Äù I said with a smile.
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù She looked at me confused. It took me a second to register what she said, I wanted to say because I loved her. 
‚ÄúWhat do you get out of it?‚Äù She was stubborn, my girl was stubborn. 
Her eyes shifted back and forth as she thought about the offer. It really was the best thing for her. And for me. She would see that in the future. Now it would just seem like a contract, but eventually she would realize that I loved her.

Is my perfect match on campus one guy or three?
I had a filthy fantasy. One so bad that the night before going to college, I had the wildest dream about the all-star football player falling at my feet. I was brought down to reality as I soon found out that life at NYU didn‚Äôt turn out the way that I hoped. All the social clubs that I joined were a bust and my roommate turned out to be far from my friend, but a bully that I needed to get as far away from as possible.
Suddenly, I got a text.
Not any ordinary text, but one so dirty that it drove my mind wild.
It messed with me.
So, I responded.
And that‚Äôs how the texting relationship started and as the texts got dirtier there was only one thing on my mind... who was this guy?
Or was it three guys?
The message tone changed depending on the time of day.
The ones I got first thing in the morning, were so hot that they could turn steel bars into pools of molten metal.
The ones in the afternoon were even better but just‚Ä¶ different.
And the texts I got in the evening were so damn dirty I could barely sleep without putting my hands between my thighs.
They were so addictive that I agreed to meet this Casanova of the text world. I had one worry, though.
What if it was three guys?
What was I going to do with all three of them at once?

Born in captivity and kept in a tank, like an animal, Terah has never seen the outside world. She knows nothing of clan life or the odd rituals of normal behavior. Rescued, she is transported to a place where she gets to swim freely in water that isn‚Äôt surrounded by walls of glass‚Äîfor the first time in her life. She had only ever heard about water like this from her mother and had never dreamt she would one day feel it flow over her.

With the water clan near-extinct, Konner continues to search the globe for members forced into hiding to survive. Each time he finds another empty lake, he feels the pains of what his people have gone through.

When one of his clan is rescued from the Tomas organization‚Äôs cruelty, he thinks maybe there‚Äôs a small chance that more of them are being kept as entertainment. With renewed hope, he sets things in motion to search for them.

She is given to the Dragon Prince, Primus, a handsome earth dragon next in line to rule the dragon throne.

When they finally touch in their true forms, Primus discovers that they are true mates. This shouldn‚Äôt be possible, since she is a human and he is a dragon.

Book 5 in the "Her Unexpected Mate" series (A SHIFT IN CIARA is Book 4).

Rae hates being a vampire even though it has its perks. Human men trip over themselves to take her home and that suits her needs just fine. Vampires are supposed to be evil, so who is she to break the millennia old tradition, even if she wishes she was different?

It's been a year since Edmund realized his childhood best friend was his fated mate, he has yet to tell her. Instead, he is forced to watch as Rae takes man after man to bed, watching from the sidelines and picking her up each time she falls.

When Edmund realizes what she is actually doing with these men, the wolf in him has to do something about it. He must tell her who she is to him before she loses herself completely into the darkness. Edmund leads Rae into his world of freedom and submission where she can release her control. When she does, Edmund's dominance grounds her, shows her she can control the hunger in her veins. He helps her fight back her self-loathing and opens her eyes to the truth.

But will Edmund‚Äôs love for her teach her to love herself? Can their new relationship survive the path fate has sent them down?

"Feeding, baby, this is feeding," he said last before he went down my neck again. And I just screamed at the pain that pierced my skin. While his lips lingered on my neck, my whole body became hotter, and at the same time, I softened.

Am I thinking correctly? Are they really true? Why do I have to?
¬†
"You really taste sweet." My eyes are getting blurry, and I can't see him properly.

I tried to reach his face despite my blurry eyes. I can see red liquid on his lips.

"You're a vampire."

"Yes, I am" was the last thing I heard before I finally closed my eyes. It's not a dream. He's the guy from that dark room.

The man with my blood on his lips.

Riley Adams is a regular teenage girl. Well, except she's constantly being made fun of because she dresses in baggy clothes. But she pays them no mind and tries her best to be invisible. Finding herself short of cash her senior year, she turns to the one thing she's good at: math! She advertises her services as a tutor in the school newspaper, hoping to earn some extra money on top of her part-time job at the library.
Tristan Harris is the exact opposite of Riley. Captain of the football team and literally the hottest guy in the entire school, he's basically what you'd call 'popular.' He's also one of Riley's worst bullies. In fact, they despise each other so much that neither one can stand to be in the same room as the other.
But what happens when Tristan realizes he's in desperate need of a math tutor?

Jackson Downing is back and he has quite a woman to deal with in ranch owner BJ Parker, but lucky for him, his brothers are there to lend a helping hand in taming the headstrong lady.

Forced to sell her family ranch to the Downing brothers, tomboyish, rough around the edges BJ Parker is less than thrilled when pretty boy, city slicker Jackson Downing shows up and begins to take charge. Used to running things on her terms, and doing things her way, BJ wants Jackson Downing gone as soon as he sets foot on her land.

Nursing a broken heart, the last thing Jackson wants to deal with is a woman, let alone a difficult one, but that's exactly what he gets in BJ. Despite what BJ thinks he's not there to become the boss, he only wants to set up drilling operations and use the time to heal his wounded heart.

From the moment they meet, sparks fly. But what begins as mutual animosity quickly develops into something more. If BJ and Jackson can put aside their distrust and dislike for each other long enough to explore the passion burning between them, they may discover a love they never expected to find.

Isabelle is an ambitious photojournalist who's tired of getting passed over for real news stories that always seemed to go to her male colleagues. When her boss sends her to New Mexico to do yet another puff piece, she can't help but wonder if it has less to do with her gender and more to do with her personally. She arrives at a secluded ranch run by Cormac, a handsome and not-so-inviting rancher, and his housekeeper and friend Tara, an older woman who knows more than she lets on. 

At first, the assignment and everyone at the ranch appears to be on the level but one night Isabelle catches a glimpse of a creature she's never seen before. A creature that looks to be half man, half wolf... Soon Isabelle finds herself plunged into a hidden world whose inhabitants the Shifters will do anything to keep their secret, and is stuck in a power struggle she hardly understands.

Can she trust Cormac, a man she can't help but be drawn to, or is he trying just as hard as the rest of them to keep her quiet? And can Cormac, torn between attraction and loyalty, help Isabelle uncover the answers about who is trying to expose the shifters to everyone?

I never thought I'd end up like this, accidentally pregnant with the most powerful and notorious Alpha Dragon‚Äôs child from a one-night stand. Yes, DRAGON, and before that, everyone thought he was a werewolf.
*
Again, the voice echoed in my mind. "Mate," it murmured, sending shivers down my spine.

"Who's there?" I demanded, my voice trembling. Panic bubbled up inside me, causing my breath to hitch and my pulse to race.

"Lyra," a deep, sultry voice called out from the shadows. A tall, broad-shouldered figure emerged, his piercing gaze locked onto mine. He was powerfully built. Bigger than my dad at six feet, he had to be at least four inches above that. Fear threatened to consume me, but as I stared into his eyes, a strange sense of comfort washed over me.
*
Lyra, the daughter of Alpha, is resented by her father for her mother's difficult birth. As a wolfless one, under stepsister's trick, betrayed by her boyfriend, ostracized by her parents, and eventually expelled from the pack. Amazingly, after leaving, she undergoes a rare shift and becomes a precious White Wolf. 

Ryan, a former prisoner of war and victim of bullying within Lyra's pack, has endured unimaginable hardships that have made him the most powerful leader of his own pack. 

Fate plays a role and the Moon goddess arranges them to be each other's destined mates. 

Despite Ryan's hatred for her, it is clear that he is not seeking revenge, but rather to conquer Lyra. From the moment they are reunited, the game begins.

The trap of her fated alpha king.

I feel my cheeks flush, the topic leaving me feeling exposed and vulnerable. I take a moment to gather my thoughts before responding honestly, "I... I have not had previous experiences, but I am willing to learn. And... and I can assure you that I am absolutely clean."

Alexander's gaze softens, and he almost seems surprised. But he eventually gives a soft laugh as he says, "I understand. Moreover, you still need to go through some tests to ensure that it is a smooth process."

When I was a little girl, I often heard stories about a man named Cain Del Roman, the one they called the 'Beast.' There were so many rumors circulating about him that it was hard to guess which among them was true. Some said that Cain was a very powerful Mage who had been cursed to sleep for eternity as punishment for abusing his power. 
But out of all the gossip, there was only one theory that made me search for him in the middle of the night: Cain was like a genie. He supposedly had the power to grant the wishes of the women who caught his interest. But of course, this came with a price. A woman had to sell her body and soul to him in order to make her wish come true.
And I was desperate. My family's lives were at stake, and Cain Del Roman, 'Beast' or no, was my family's only hope of surviving. That's why I promised myself I'd do everything in my power to awaken him, even if that meant becoming a sinner...

An angel like her‚Ä¶ and a devil like me. Was it wrong to prey on the weak?

Especially when the weak came in the form of this beautiful angel on the doorstep of my club. My club The Dark Odyssey. The place where people live out their wildest fantasies. Here, beneath the mask. Nothing is off limits and just like Vegas, what happens here stays here. She‚Äôs too angelic for the wild masquerade parties I hold. She couldn‚Äôt possibly know she‚Äôs standing at the doorway to sin. It‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs here for something else. I smell desperation and fear‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôve already decided she‚Äôll be mine. I‚Äôve found the perfect toy to play with. I‚Äôm Nick Giordano and I always get what I want. I want her body. Obedience. Submission. Heart and soul. I‚Äôll claim her. I‚Äôll break her, and possess her. She‚Äôs the perfect distraction from my enemies. And, the darkness of my world.

Welcome to The Dark Odyssey, Angel Doll. I hope you enjoy your stay, I know I will.
